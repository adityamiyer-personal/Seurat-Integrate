## Introduction

`SeuratIntegrate`'s main purpose is to extend the range of scRNA-seq integration
tools available in R and compatible with `Seurat`. Many of them being solely
available in python, we developed wrappers leveraging `reticulate` package's
capabilities. `reticulate` enables to directly call python from  R, give that
conda environments have been set up beforehand.

The purpose of this vignette is to illustrate and ease the installation and the
use of those environments.

Prior to starting, make sure you have:

- conda **installed** on your machine
- conda binary in your **`PATH`** (or that you know its location)

## Set-up

We need multiple conda environments. One for `bbknn`, one for `Scanorama`, one
for `scVI`/`scANVI` and one for `trVAE`. If you don't plan on using any or some
of these methods, whether you decide to set up their respective conda
environments is up to you.

One the contrary, if you already have some conda environments with appropriate
libraries on your machine, you can tell `SeuratIntegrate` to use them.
Let's see how.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(SeuratIntegrate)
```

Have look at your `CondaEnvManager`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getCache()
```
```{r png-conda-unset, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./img/conda_envs_unset.png')
```

It's a handy way to have a glance at all the implemented methods and the status
of their conda environments. `ComBat`, `Harmony` and `MNN` are R-based methods
and don't need any conda environment. The rest of them however are python-based
and will function through `reticulate`, hence require conda environments.

If you don't have any conda environments for them, look at the [next sub-section](#create_env).
Conversely, if you want to add an existing conda environment, directly go to the
[following one](#use_env).

### Option 1: Create new conda environments with `SeuratIntegrate` {#create_env}

**Note that the commands below have only been tested on Linux distributions**

Try the following commands (be aware that execution might take time):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
UpdateEnvCache('bbknn')
UpdateEnvCache('scvi')
UpdateEnvCache('scanorama')
UpdateEnvCache('trvae')
```

Note that:

- if conda is not in you PATH set `conda.bin = /path/to/conda`
- `scVI` and `scANVI` share the same environment. Hence, it is not necessary to
run both `UpdateEnvCache('scvi')` and `UpdateEnvCache('scanvi')`

Have look at your `CondaEnvManager`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getCache()
```
```{r png-conda-set, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./img/conda_envs_set.png')
```

### Option 2: Use existing conda environments {#use_env}

If you already have one (several) existing conda environment(s) for one (some)
of the methods, you can tell `SeuratIntegrate` to use it (them). Similarly, if
you run into problems with `UpdateEnvCache()` commands above, the alternative is
to set up conda environments yourself and provide them to `SeuratIntegrate`.
Whatever the case, let's proceed.

You'll use `UpdateEnvCache()`. You can specify the name of the conda environment
or the path to it. By default, `UpdateEnvCache()` will try to decide whether the
provided value for `conda.env` is a path or a name based on simple tests. To
avoid any misinterpretation, you can use `conda.env.is.path = TRUE` or `FALSE`
when your input is the path or the name of the environment, respectively.
**But beware not to make mistakes !!!**

See examples below. You shall adapt the arguments to your situation:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# environment for bbknn
UpdateEnvCache('bbknn', conda.env = 'bbknn_env',
               conda.env.is.path = FALSE)   # default 'auto' would work

# environment for bbknn in ./bbknn_env/
UpdateEnvCache('bbknn', conda.env = 'bbknn_env',
               conda.env.is.path = TRUE)

# environment for bbknn, conda binary not in PATH
UpdateEnvCache('bbknn', conda.env = 'bbknn_env', conda.bin = 'cutom/location/conda')

# path for scvi-tools
UpdateEnvCache('scvi', conda.env = '~/miniconda3/envs/scvi-tools_env',
               conda.env.is.path = TRUE)   # default 'auto' would work
```

Note that:

- if conda is not in you PATH set `conda.bin = /path/to/conda`
- the `conda.bin` must correspond to the conda managing the `conda.env`
- `scVI` and `scANVI` share the same environment. Hence, it is not necessary to
run both `UpdateEnvCache('scvi')` and `UpdateEnvCache('scanvi')`

Now you can use the python-based methods !

###  Update or reset conda environments

If you want to update a `conda` environment, use
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# change 'method' by the name of the method
UpdateEnvCache(method = 'method', overwrite.env = TRUE, ...)
```

To unset an environment, use
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# change 'method' by the name of the method
resetCache(method = 'method')
```

## Troubleshouting with conda

### Common issues with setting up environments {#install_problem}

It can happen that a conda environment cannot be installed on a specific machine
or os. In this case, there is hardly anything better to do than browse the
internet in hope that someone else has experienced a similar problem and that
the solution is public. Otherwise, try to modify the set of packages to install,
be more or less stringent with package versions to install, etc. You can also
create a conda environment with python and pip, and then to try to install
packages with pip rather than conda.

Once the problem is solved (if it can be), you can save the new environment to
the `CondaEnvManager` with
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# change 'method' by the name of the method
# change'difficult_conda_env' by the name of the working conda environment
UpdateEnvCache(method = 'method', conda.env = 'difficult_conda_env')
```


### Possible issues with activating environments {#load_problem}

It can happen that a conda environment does not work (or stops working) on a
specific machine. Below are some potential causes of conflicts between Python
libraries, conda itself or other components that could lead to malfunctions
(non exhaustive list):

1. **with rmarkdown/knitr**

<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to check*</summary>
Check if the same command works outside of an rmarkdown (e.g. in a R script),
once you have closed any Rmardown file and closed the R session (and restrated
RStudio). This is something to consider notably when you encounter an error like:

```{r class.source='red-warn', eval=FALSE, highlight=FALSE}
ImportError: /opt/conda/envs/[env_name]/lib/python3.10/site-packages/PIL/../../../libtiff.so.6: undefined symbol: jpeg12_write_raw_data, version LIBJPEG_8.0
```
</details></ol>
<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to fix*</summary>
Close any Rmardown file in the source panel, quit the R session (close RStudio)
and work from a R script.
</details></ol>

2. **with RStudio**

<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to check*</summary>
Check if the same command works outside of RStudio.
For instance, if there is an error during an integration because scanpy cannot
be imported, try:

```
# from a terminal
R
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
> library(reticulate)
> use_condaenv('[conda_env_name]')
> scanpy <- import("scanpy", convert = FALSE)
# error here ?
> 
```

</details></ol>
<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to fix*</summary>
Lunch the integration outside of RStudio (from a terminal for example).
</details></ol>


3. **with reticulate**

<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to check*</summary>
Check if the conda environment loads properly in a pure python session.
For instance, if there is an error during an integration because scanpy cannot
be imported, try to:

```
conda activate [conda_env_name]
python
```
```{python, eval = FALSE}
>>> import scanpy
# error here ?
>>>
```

</details></ol>
<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to fix*</summary>
First, try to update reticulate. If it doesn't work any better, check if someone
has encountered the same issue (browse the web or the issues on the reticulate
github repository. If nothing works, either post an issue on the reticulate
github repos or retry to import after you have installed different python
package versions.

If this is a problem with `mkl`, install the conda environment
again with the arguments `nomkl` (and `-c conda-forge` if not already).
</details></ol>

4. **between python packages**

<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to check*</summary>
This is more tricky. But some packages are know to be incompatible. For instance,
jax and jaxlib work better when their versions are identical. In my experience,
the `scvi-tools` environment can be set up with two discrepant versions of jax
and jaxlib. To check, try:

```
conda list -n [conda_env_name] jax
```

</details></ol>
<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to fix*</summary>
If this is a problem with jax and jaxlib, try to force install them with
identical versions. Otherwise, search your error on the web.
</details></ol>

5. **between your local os and the list of packages to be installed by
SeuratIntegrate**

<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to check*</summary>
This is more an installation problem usually. Check the [previous section](#install_problem).
</details></ol>
<ol><details>
  <summary>*How to fix*</summary>

## Subtleties of using Future

If the following bullet points seem obscure, further explanations are given in
the sections below. In brief,

<blockquote style="font-size: 1em;">
-   **disable future** for R-based methods (`DoIntegrate([...], use.future = FALSE)`)
-   **never use** `CCA` and `RPCA` integration methods with multisession
(previous advice prevents this, especially for Windows users)
-   multicore futures are faster and less memory-intensive than multisession,
but unstable on RStudio and **unavailable on Windows**
-   to force `DoIntegrate()` to use a multicore framework (at your own risk),
set `options(parallelly.fork.enable = FALSE)`. **Unavailable on Windows**
</blockquote>


### Why SeuratIntegrate uses Future ?

A R session can only initialise one Python environment at a time via reticulate.
This [known](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/109823/multiple-conda-enviroments-in-r-functions-using-reticulate#110554)
[limitation](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/reference/use_python.html#caveats-1)
of `reticualte` is overcome by launching a "*background session*" using `Future`.
The environment is initialised there instead of the main user's R session. This
feature is embedded in `DoIntegrate()`.

Futures are therefore useless for R-based methods and should be disabled with
`DoIntegrate([...], use.future = FALSE)`. Worse, it is **discouraged** with
`CCAIntegration` and `RPCAIntegration` (explanations are in the final part of
the vignette)

### Inconveniences

In the vast majority of cases, the impact of the "*futures*" is insignificant.
The most obvious are the few needed seconds to launch the future session and
export globals, in addition to the [reordering of stdout and message output](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/vignettes/future-2-output.html),
resulting in messy and less informative print statements intended for the user.

### Tweaks

The package implements sequential, multicore, multisession, and cluster futures.
`SeuratIntegrate` only uses the multicore and multisession ones. `DoIntegrate()`
automatically picks the preferred one based on the output of

```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(parallelly.fork.enable = FALSE)
```
```{r}
parallelly::supportsMulticore()
```

Here multicore is not supported, thus `DoIntegrate()` would start a multisession.
Further explanations regarding settings giving priority to multicore are
available in the function's help (the important part is in the disclosure widget
`?supportsMulticore`)

```{r help-command, eval=FALSE}
help('supportsMulticore', package = 'parallelly')
```

<details>
  <summary>`?supportsMulticore`</summary>
```{r help-extract, echo=FALSE}
help_file <- utils:::.getHelpFile(help('supportsMulticore', 'parallelly'))
out_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".html")
tools:::Rd2HTML(help_file, out = out_file)
lines_html <- readLines(out_file)
h_idx <- intersect(grep("^<h3>", lines_html), grep("fork|Example", lines_html))
lines_html <- lines_html[h_idx[1]:(h_idx[length(h_idx)] - 1)]
lines_html <- sub("<h3>", "<h4>", lines_html)

knitr::asis_output('<blockquote style="font-size: 1em;">')
knitr::asis_output(htmltools::htmlPreserve(paste(lines_html, collapse="\n")))
knitr::asis_output('</blockquote>')
```
</details>

<br />In a nutshell, multicore is

-   unavailable on Windows
-   discouraged (considered unstable) in some R environments, notably RStudio
-   always used on Unix-like operating systems when
`options(parallelly.fork.enable = TRUE)` 

The main reason for using multicore is that FORKing is considered to be faster
and result in a lower memory overhead than PSOCK (i.e. multisession) (see [there](https://r-bayesian-networks.org/articles/multiprocessing.html#fork-vs--psock)
for technical details)

Furthermore, `DoIntegrate()` uses not only future, but also NSE
(non-standard evaluation), enabling to specify arguments within each integration
function call. Briefly, each call inside `DoIntegrate()`
(such as `DoIntegrate(bbknnIntegration())`) is not directly executed but
*captured* to be executed later on (so that the proper value for the `object`
parameter can be passed on to `bbknnIntegration` for instance). Further details
are available in the book
[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html) by Hadley
Wickham.

The important part is that, unlike for multicore, on a multisession future,
`DoIntegrate()` evaluates each argument before launching the integration on the
background R session. Thus, a Seurat Assay object is passed as a `str`ucture
(output of `str(object)`). This takes time and makes the call extremely long.

It has a unexpected side-effect. It slows down `CCAIntegration` and
`RPCAIntegration` a lot when they are input with Seurat objects normalised with
`SCTransform()`. Indeed, they both call `FindIntegrationAnchors()` -> `merge()`
-> `merge.SCTAssay()`. The latter performs a `grep` on the previous calls
(output of `sys.calls()`). In a multisession future, big objects such as the
Seurat Assay object are passed as a `str`ucture and the `grep` can be
unnecessarily time-consuming. To avoid this, one can either specify
`use.future = FALSE` for the R-based method (this is always preferable) or at
least ban the use of `CCA` and `RPCA` integrations with a multisession future
(note that Windows users can only pick the first option).


<!-- Now you can use the python-based methods ! -->

<!-- However, you can only load and attach one conda environment per R session. If -->
<!-- you plan to use multiple python-based methods, you need to launch as many -->
<!-- sessions as integrations using those methods. To circumvent this limitation of -->
<!-- reticulate, you can take advantage of the R package `future`. It allows you to -->
<!-- launch background R sessions, in such a way that the conda environments will be -->
<!-- loaded on those sessions and not on the main one. Simply follow one of the -->
<!-- syntaxes below (`seu` is a Seurat object, and `IntegrateLayers()` is the -->
<!-- function to call any integration method): -->

<!-- ### Working on RStudio and outside -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- library(future) -->

<!-- plan(multisession) -->
<!-- seu %<-% { IntegrateLayers(seu, method = bbknnIntegration) } %seed% 42L # seu is a promise -->
<!-- seu                                                                     # seu is evaluated -->
<!-- plan(multisession) -->
<!-- seu %<-% { IntegrateLayers(seu, method = scVIIntegration) } %seed% 42L  # seu is a promise -->
<!-- seu                                                                     # seu is evaluated -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Not working on RStudio -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- library(future) -->

<!-- plan(multicore) # needed just once -->
<!-- seu %<-% { IntegrateLayers(seu, method = bbknnIntegration) } %seed% 42L # seu is a promise -->
<!-- seu                                                                     # seu is evaluated -->
<!-- seu %<-% { IntegrateLayers(seu, method = scVIIntegration) } %seed% 42L  # seu is a promise -->
<!-- seu                                                                     # seu is evaluated -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### In case of failing -->

<!-- In practice, if an error is thrown during the evaluation, the Seurat object -->
<!-- would be lost and `seu` would stay a (failed) promise. To avoid this, we can use -->
<!-- another syntax: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- library(future) -->

<!-- plan(multisession) #or plan(multicore) -->

<!--  f <- future({ IntegrateLayers(seu, method = bbknnIntegration) })  # f is a promise -->
<!--  seu <- value(f)                                                   # f is evaluated -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The difference comes from the fact that the promise is evaluated at the last -->
<!-- line. If an error is thrown, the variable `seu` is handled by R, preventing it -->
<!-- to be overwritten. Because it is safer, it might come in handy if you are not -->
<!-- familiar with integration methods from `SeuratIntegrate`. -->

<!-- Another error occurs when the total size of exported objects is too high. -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Error in getGlobalsAndPackages(expr, envir = envir, globals = TRUE) :  -->
<!--   The total size of the X globals that need to be exported for the future expression ('FUN()') is X GiB. This exceeds the maximum allowed size of 500.00 MiB (option 'future.globals.maxSize'). The X largest globals are ... -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- By default, `future` allows 500MB per thread. `Seurat` objects tend to grow -->
<!-- quickly, hence it might be necessary to increase the limit. Below is an example -->
<!-- to allow 1.5GB per thread: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- library(future) -->
<!-- ngb <- 1.5  # 1.5GB -->
<!-- options(future.globals.maxSize = ngb * 1e3 * 1024 ^ 2)  -->

<!-- plan(multisession) #or plan(multicore) -->
<!-- # ... -->
<!-- ``` -->
