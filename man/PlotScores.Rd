\arguments{
\item{object}{a Seurat object}

\item{plot.type}{one of 'table' (default), 'radar' or 'lollipop'. Type of
desired plot}

\item{split.by.score.type}{whether to split scores by type (bio-conservation,
batch correction and overall scores). When set to \code{FALSE}, all scores
are mixed in a single figure.}

\item{order.by}{one of 'score' (default), 'name' or 'asis'. Determines the
order of integrations in the legend (and on the y-axis for lolliplop and
table plots). Scores are ordered by decreasing overall score by default,
by name or by row-order when setting 'name' and 'asis' respectively.}

\item{hide.zeros}{whether zero(ed) scores should be visible on the plot.}

\item{include.integration}{name of the integration(s) to include. The
default value (\code{NULL}) enable to include them all.}

\item{exclude.integration}{name of the integration(s) to exclude. The default
value (\code{NULL}) enable to include them all.}

\item{include.score}{name of the score(s) to include. The default value
(\code{NULL}) enable to include them all.}

\item{exclude.score}{name of the score(s) to exclude. The default value
(\code{NULL}) enable to include them all.}

\item{recompute.overall.scores}{whether to recompute overall scores. Useful
when some scores or integrations are excluded. When \code{FALSE},
coefficient parameters have no impact.}

\item{rescale}{whether to rescale each score between 0 and 1 using min-max
normalisation before computing overall scores. One of 'rank' (default),
'score' or 'none'. The first two enable rescaling on ranks and scores
respectively, while 'none' disables rescaling. Rescaling ensures that each
metric equally contributes to the overall scores. 'rank' is more stable to
changes in integrations included. Has no effect when
\code{recompute.overall.scores = FALSE}.}

\item{batch.coeff}{the weight of batch correction performance evaluation
scores in the overall score.}

\item{bio.coeff}{the weight of bio-conservation performance evaluation scores
in the overall score.}

\item{point.max.size}{inoperative unless \code{plot.type = 'table'} and
\code{use.ggforce = FALSE}. Determine the maximum size of the points
(only achieved for a score of 1) to fit the plotting area (handled
automaticaly when ggforce is used).}

\item{use.ggforce}{for \code{plot.type = 'table'}, enable or disable the use
of \pkg{ggforce} to draw the circles. Used by default when the package is
installed}

\value{

\description{
Plot the scaled integration scores to compare the obtained integrations
}
\details{
The \code{rescale} parameter controls how scores are rescaled prior to
computing overall scores. Thus, when \code{rescale != 'none'},
\code{recompute.overall.scores} should be \code{TRUE} (default). Otherwise,
the overall scores will no longer match the scores displayed on the plot.

Albeit the min-max rescaling of scores in Luecken M.D. \emph{et al.}, 2022 is
achievable with \code{rescale = 'score'}, min-max rescaling on ranks
(\code{rescale = 'rank'}) is the default. Indeed, it results in more stable
rankings of overall scores when the list of integrations to plot is
modified.

To plot non-rescaled scores, make sure to use
\code{\link{ScaleScores}(..., rescale = "none")} beforehand. To plot rescaled
scores however, the \code{rescale} parameter of \code{\link{ScaleScores}} has
no impact on the scores obtained for plotting.
